# Java Basics: Sorting and Array Operations

This repository contains simple Java programs demonstrating basic algorithms and array operations. The code includes implementations of the Bubble Sort algorithm, finding the largest element in an array, and calculating the sum of array elements.

## Features

- **Bubble Sort**: Sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- **Largest Element**: Finds the largest element in a given array.
- **Sum of Array**: Calculates the sum of all elements in an array.

## How to Run
